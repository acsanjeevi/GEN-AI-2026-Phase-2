        <td>Clarity</td>
        <td>The story is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear acceptance criteria. However, some scenarios, such as password reset or account lockout, are not explicitly mentioned.</td>

        <td>Completeness</td>
        <td>Acceptance criteria are well-defined, but preconditions, such as user registration or password policies, could be more explicitly stated.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Business Value Alignment</td>
        <td>Strong relevance to healthcare security and compliance, as secure login functionality is essential for protecting sensitive patient data.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Testability</td>
        <td>Test cases can be easily derived from the acceptance criteria, but additional scenarios, such as concurrent login attempts or password expiration, should be considered.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Technical Feasibility</td>
        <td>Practically implementable within typical healthcare system constraints, but considerations for integration with existing EHR systems or compliance with regulations like HIPAA should be explicitly addressed.</td>
